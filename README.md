# Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast retail store sales using historical sales and store information datasets.  

# ⚠️ **Note:** Project is under development and will be updated daily.

## Day 1 – Progress
- Loaded train (daily sales) and store datasets using Python (pandas).  
- Merged datasets on `Store` ID, repeating store info for each day.  
- Checked data types and converted `Date` column to datetime.  
- Inspected missing values and planned handling.  
- Visualized missing values using a heatmap (Seaborn).  
- Checked for duplicate rows and removed if any.  
- Explored dataset shapes and basic statistics.  
- Saved cleaned and merged dataset for further analysis.  

## Next Steps (will come regularly)
- Explore missing values more thoroughly and handle them.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- Analyze sales trends by store, day, week, and promotions.  
- Prepare for predictive modeling and sales forecasting.  
- and many more...
